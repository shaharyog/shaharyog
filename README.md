# Shahar Yogev 💻🚀

## About Me
Hi! I'm a programmer with a passion for low-level and high-performance code. I enjoy exploring topics like memory corruption and building efficient systems. My technical skills include:

- **Languages**: C++, C#, C, Python, Rust, Flutter (Dart), Bash...
- **Interests**: Systems Programming, CTFs, Cybersecurity, Software Engineering

I'm always open to new challenges, whether it's solving CTF puzzles, learning about system internals, or collaborating on projects. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat or work together!

## 🕹️ Cybersecurity & Challenges
CTFs and competitive hacking are my playground. I specialize in the following areas:

- **Binary Exploitation**: Exploring system vulnerabilities
- **Reverse Engineering (RE)**: Analyzing software to understand its behavior
- **Penetration Testing**: Identifying and resolving security weaknesses

I also have an interest in **Forensics** and **Web Security**, though these are secondary to my main focus.

## 🔭 Current Projects
- I'm working on an operating system written entirely in Rust. It's a challenging but rewarding project.

## 🌱 Learning
- Currently focused on **Operating Systems**, **Concurrency** in Rust, and **Low-Level Memory Management**.

## 📍 Let's Collaborate
