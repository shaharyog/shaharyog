# Shahar Yogev 💻🚀

## About Me
Hi! I'm a programmer with a passion for low-level and high-performance code. I enjoy exploring topics like memory corruption and building efficient systems. My technical skills include:

- **Languages**: C++, C#, C, Python, Rust, Flutter (Dart), Bash...
- **Interests**: Systems Programming, CTFs, Cybersecurity, Software Engineering

I'm always open to new challenges, whether it's solving CTF puzzles, learning about system internals, or collaborating on projects. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat or work together!

## 🎮 Cybersecurity & Challenges
CTFs and competitive hacking are my playground. I specialize in the following areas:

- **Exploitation**: Finding and leveraging system vulnerabilities
- **Reverse Engineering**: Analyzing software and understanding its inner workings
- **Web & Network Security**: Identifying and mitigating security risks in applications and networks
- **Cryptography & Forensics**: Exploring encryption, data recovery, and investigative techniques

## 💡 Learning & CTFs
- Currently focused on **Operating Systems**, **Concurrency** in Rust, and **Low-Level Memory Management**.
- Actively learning and participating in **CTFs**, sharpening my skills in security challenges and exploit development.

## 📝 Current Projects
- I'm working on an operating system written entirely in Rust. It's a challenging but rewarding project.
